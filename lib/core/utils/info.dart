(Verse 1)  In my crib, plotting schemes,  Got my laser, caught in memes,  Diabolical, oh so sly,  World domination? Oh, why not try!

(Chorus)  Itâ€™s a Stewie world, join the wacky ride,  Dance like a toddler, with a villain's pride,  Messed up the plans? Well, thatâ€™s okay,  Iâ€™m the tiny tyrant, letâ€™s just call it play!

(Verse 2)  Brian's rolling his eyes, but Iâ€™m on a roll,  Spilling juice, oh no! Thatâ€™s how I lose control,  Megâ€™s in the corner, with her phone in hand,  "What the deuce!" I just canâ€™t understand!

(Chorus)  Itâ€™s a Stewie world, come and dance with me,  Twirling like a baby, in a diaper spree,  If my plans go south, Iâ€™ll just laugh it off,  Iâ€™m the tiny tyrant, do you wanna scoff?

(Bridge)  Diapers full of secrets, plans that are lame,  Iâ€™ll rule the universe? Yeah, right, what a game!  With a giggle and a jig, Iâ€™ll make my play,  "Vile woman!" youâ€™ll rue the day!

(Chorus)  Itâ€™s a Stewie world, join the wacky ride,  Dance like a toddler, with a villain's pride,  Messed up the plans? Well, thatâ€™s okay,  Iâ€™m the tiny tyrant, letâ€™s just call it play!

(Outro)  So grab your bottle, letâ€™s make a toast,  To the little genius who canâ€™t do the most,  With a wink and a grin, Iâ€™ll take my throne,  Stewieâ€™s here, with my rattle, Iâ€™m never alone!

(Verse 1)
In the shadows, darkness looms,
But we rise to face the doom.
With our strength and hearts combined,
Together, we will never fall behind.

(Chorus)
Heroes unite, standing tall,
In the face of danger, weâ€™ll never stall.
With a bond unbreakable, weâ€™ll fight as one,
For justice and freedom, our battles begun.

(Verse 2)
Through the storms and through the night,
Weâ€™ll defend the weak, weâ€™ll bring the light.
With courage in our hearts, weâ€™ll take the stand,
Fighting for peace in this troubled land.

(Chorus)
Heroes unite, standing tall,
In the face of danger, weâ€™ll never stall.
With a bond unbreakable, weâ€™ll fight as one,
For justice and freedom, our battles begun.

(Bridge)
Together weâ€™ll rise, together weâ€™ll soar,
With every challenge, weâ€™ll face even more.
In the name of honor, weâ€™ll carry the flame,
As legends of valor, weâ€™ll rise to fame.

(Chorus)
Heroes unite, standing tall,
In the face of danger, weâ€™ll never stall.
With a bond unbreakable, weâ€™ll fight as one,
For justice and freedom, our battles begun.

(Verse 1)  In the land of four nations, a legend was born,  A child of the skies, with a heart never torn.  With the whispers of the wind and the strength of the sea,  Aang rose to the challenge, our hope to be free.

(Chorus)  Oh, Aang, the last airbender,  Guardian of peace, a light to remember.  With the power of elements, you stood so tall,  The greatest of Avatars, you answered the call.

(Verse 2)  From the icy cold waters to the mountains so high,  You danced with the flames, let your spirit fly.  The Avatar cycle, you carried with grace,  With friends by your side, youâ€™d never lose face.

(Chorus)  Oh, Aang, the last airbender,  Guardian of peace, a light to remember.  With the power of elements, you stood so tall,  The greatest of Avatars, you answered the call.

(Bridge)  In the darkest of times, you shone like a star,  Bringing hope to the world, no matter how far.  Your journey's a tale, of courage and love,  Aang, our dear friend, youâ€™re a gift from above.

(Chorus)  Oh, Aang, the last airbender,  Guardian of peace, a light to remember.  With the power of elements, you stood so tall,  The greatest of Avatars, you answered the call.
